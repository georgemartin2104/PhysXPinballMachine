PhysXTutorial
=============

This was built on a premade PhysXTutorial but instead includes a 3D playable pinball machine using various aspects of the physics engine.
This includes materials, motors and general use of the debugging GUI.

Although basic in nature, the machine was completely created using PhysX, and is playable with a basic time-based scoring system.
